00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Hey I is probably the most important thing humanity is

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.707
that has ever worked on and I think of it

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:09.512
as something more profound than electricity or fire and anytime

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:09.750
you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
work with technology you need to learn to harness the

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.100
benefits.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.050
And while minimizing the downside.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.912
You know stepping back when you think about you know

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.663
a lot of problems in the world today it's because

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:25.690
we typically have a constraint on resources AI for the

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.930
first time I think overtime offers a different construct.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.254
Things which are constrained and look like a zero sum

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.013
game today may not be so in the future take

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:40.090
education for example it's really difficult to educate people in

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.252
a cost effective way of AI mean fundamentally changed that

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:44.970
equation.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.106
It may make it possible for us to have clean

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.000
cheap renewable energy for the future.
